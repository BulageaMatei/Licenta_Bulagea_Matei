The construction of an automatic image processing application is being pursued. An image with a human face is given. First the problem is to automatically decide whether the person has a face mask. If so, segment the area with the mask. In parallel, the person is recognized, based on the upper part of the face. Then it is desired to replace the lower area of ​​the face, covered with the mask, with the corresponding part of an image of the same person, but without the mask. The project is implemented in Pytorch.

Initial:
